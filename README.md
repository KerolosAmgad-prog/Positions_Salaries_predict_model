# Position Level vs. Salary Prediction using Polynomial Regression

This project demonstrates the use of Polynomial Regression to predict salary based on an employee's position level. It utilizes the scikit-learn library in Python to model non-linear relationships between the position level and salary.

## Overview

In many real-world scenarios, the relationship between variables isn't linear. This project explores how Polynomial Regression can be used to fit a curve to data, providing a more accurate prediction when a linear model would be insufficient. We analyze the relationship between an employee's position level and their salary.

## Files

* `position_salaries_predict_model.py`: The main Python script containing the code for data loading, polynomial feature transformation, model training, prediction, and visualization.
* (Assuming you have a data file, e.g., `Position_Salaries.csv`, in the same directory - the script implies this).

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you are viewing this on GitHub).
2.  **Ensure you have the required libraries installed:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas
    ```
3.  **Place your data file** (e.g., `Position_Salaries.csv`) in the same directory as `position_salaries_predict_model.py`.
4.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python position_salaries_predict_model.py
    ```

## Methodology

1.  **Data Loading:** The script loads the dataset containing position levels and corresponding salaries (the specific file name isn't explicitly in the provided snippet but is implied).
2.  **Polynomial Feature Transformation:** The independent variable (Position Level) is transformed into polynomial features (e.g., x, x², x³, ...) to capture non-linear relationships.
3.  **Model Training:** A Linear Regression model is trained on these transformed polynomial features.
4.  **Prediction:** The trained model is used to predict salaries for various position levels, including a dense grid for smooth visualization.
5.  **Visualization:** The original data points and the fitted polynomial regression curve are plotted to visualize the model's performance.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Polynomial Regression
* Feature Transformation using `PolynomialFeatures` from scikit-learn
* Training a Linear Regression model on transformed features
* Visualizing non-linear regression models

## Further Improvements

* Experiment with different degrees of the polynomial to find the optimal fit.
* Evaluate the model using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error).
* Split the data into training and testing sets for a more robust evaluation.
