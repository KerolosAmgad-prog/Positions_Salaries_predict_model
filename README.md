Position Salary Prediction using Polynomial Regression
Overview
This project predicts salaries for different job positions using Polynomial Regression (degree=4) and compares it with Linear Regression. The dataset includes position levels and corresponding salaries.

Key Steps
Data Preprocessing: Extracts position levels and salaries.

Model Training:

Linear Regression (baseline).

Polynomial Regression (non-linear relationship capture).

Visualization: Compares model fits with smooth curves.

Prediction: Predicts salaries for new position levels (e.g., level 6.5).

Dataset
Position_Salaries.csv with columns:

Position: Job title (encoded as levels).

Salary: Corresponding salary.

Dependencies
Python 3

Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Usage
Clone the repository.

Install dependencies: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib.

Run the script: python position_salaries_predict_model.py.
